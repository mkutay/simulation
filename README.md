# WE GET THESE 100S

This simulation project integrates multiple components to create a dynamic ecosystem that a researcher can use to
study predator-prey-plant interactions, with the ability to add or remove any species or environmental factors easily
by editing the given JSON file. Infact, almost every aspect of the simulation can be controlled in the JSON file.
The simulation is designed to simulate without any grid-based restrictions, allowing entities to move freely in a
continuous space. Specifically, the coordinates of the entities are stored as doubles from zero to the width and height
of the field. The entities also have their own genetics, which are inherited from parent(s) and may mutate,
all of which are initialised in the JSON file, where it is intended for all users of the program to modify it
to play with the simulation parameters.
