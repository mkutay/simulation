# WE GET THESE 100S

Since we've learned how to test in Java, we will probably be required to write some tests in JUnit, so I also set up that.

You should open this on VSCode codespaces, which you should be able to run the code itself directly. You can also run and see the tests.

These code were taking from last week's lab sheet, but we'll change them later.

I've also created two different codespaces for us to use, so that it doesn't get mixed up.
