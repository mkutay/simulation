        \section{Introduction}
        \noindent This simulation project integrates multiple components to create a dynamic ecosystem that a researcher can use to
        study predator-prey-plant interactions, with the ability to add or remove any species or environmental factors easily
        by editing the given JSON file. Infact, almost every aspect of the simulation can be controlled in the JSON file.
        The simulation is designed to simulate without any grid-based restrictions, allowing entities to move freely in a
        continuous space. Specifically, the coordinates of the entities are stored as doubles from zero to the width and height
        of the field. The entities also now have their own genetics, which are inherited from parent(s) and may mutate,
        all of which are initialised in the JSON file.

        We intend for all users of the program to modify the JSON file to play with the simulation parameters.

        \noindent The simulation smoothly runs at 60 frames per second by utilising a \verb|QuadTree| to store entities, which allows
        the entity searching and collision detection to be highly optimised. In each simulation "step," every entity is updated
        by calling its \verb|update()| method, which handles movement, reproduction, and hunger.
        Entities make decisions based on other entities in their vicinity (that is, entities that are located inside their
        \verb|sight| radius) and the current state of the environment (weather and time of day). Additionally, there is a
        method to handle overcrowding in the simulation, for limiting the growth of entities from being unnaturally rapid.

        \section{Tasks Lists and Implementation Details}

        \subsection{Base Tasks}

        \noindent \textbf{Diverse Species:} With how the simulation is implemented, adding new species is as easy as adding
        the species' behavioural data into a JSON file. Each entity species can be of type \verb|Prey|, \verb|Predator|,
        or \verb|Plant|, and the data is added accordingly. For example, for the predator \verb|Fox|, the following definitions
        are used:
        \begin{verbatim}
{
  "name": "Fox",
  "multiplyingRate": [0.05, 0.15],
  "maxLitterSize": [1, 4],
  "maxAge": [80, 120],
  "matureAge": [40, 40],
  "mutationRate": [0.01, 0.05],
  "maxSpeed": [4, 6.5],
  "sight": [30, 50],
  "numberOfEntitiesAtStart": 12,
  "eats": ["Rabbit"],
  "size": [3, 6],
  "colour": [230, 20, 40],
  "overcrowdingThreshold": [8, 25],
  "overcrowdingRadius": [10, 15],
  "maxOffspringSpawnDistance": [3, 5]
}
        \end{verbatim}
        \vspace{-0.7cm}
        \noindent The values that are arrays and contain two values (such as \verb|sight|, \verb|size|, or \verb|maxSpeed|) represent
        the minimum and the maximum values that the entity can have for that genetic trait. In addition, these values can mutate when
        the entity breeds/multiplies. However, \verb|numberOfEntitiesAtStart| and \verb|eats| are fixed values that are not subject
        to mutation, as they are not genetic traits and they define what the entity is in the context of the simulation.
        Finally, the following entities are considered in the simulation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \verb|Grass| — Plant.
            \item \verb|Rabbit| — Prey, eats grass.
            \item \verb|Squirrel| — Prey, eats grass.
            \item \verb|Wolf| — Predator, eats rabbit and squirrel.
            \item \verb|Fox| — Predator, eats rabbit.
            \item \verb|Bear| — Predator, eats wolf and fox.
        \end{itemize}

        \noindent \textbf{Two Predators Competes for the Same Food Source:}
        With the JSON configuration file, it is quite easy to add multiple species for any type of entity. In this case, only two
        predators (\verb|Wolf| and \verb|Fox|) compete for the same food source (\verb|Rabbit|), which is a prey species.
        The \verb|Bear| is also added as a predator that eats both wolves and foxes.

        \noindent \textbf{Distinguishing Gender:} Each animal has their own gender, represented in their genetics,
        which affects reproduction mechanics. Only animals of opposite genders can reproduce. Specifically, the gender genetic trait
        is implemented as an Enum with two values: \verb|MALE| and \verb|FEMALE|. Plants do not have gender in the genetics system,
        meaning that they reproduce asexually.

        \noindent \textbf{Tracking Time of Day:} An \verb|Environment| class is used to track the time of day and the weather,
        which governs how both cycles impact entity behaviour. During the night, entities will not move unless they are hungry
        or there is a predator nearby. Additionally, when sleeping, food consumption is reduced. The day-night cycle can be controlled
        by the JSON file, and the time of day is displayed on the screen. Additionally, as the day progresses into the night,
        the screen darkens to represent the time of day, without affecting the text on the screen.

        \subsection{Challenge Tasks}

        \noindent \textbf{Adding Plants:} Plants have been added, featuring growth and reproduction dynamics.
        Plants die when they detect too many plants of the same species nearby (as determined by their overcrowding genetics:
        \verb|overcrowdingThreshold| and \verb|overcrowdingRadius|), which results in natural looking patches of grass.

        \noindent \textbf{Adding Weather:} As mentioned, weather is added under the \verb|Environment| class, wherein
        weather conditions influence behavior and visibility, increasing the realism in the simulation environment.
        There are 4 weather conditions:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \verb|Clear| — No effect on entities.
            \item \verb|Raining| — Plants grow faster (by a defined factor in the plant genetics).
            \item \verb|Windy| — Pushes entities in the wind direction, even when they are sleeping.
            Wind direction is visualised for the ease of the user.
            \item \verb|Stormy| — Slows down entities by some factor and has the effect of windy. Different to
            windy condition, stormy condition is more severe, in the sense that the wind changes directions much more rapidly.
        \end{itemize}

        \noindent \textbf{Genetics System:} As one of the self-admitted challenges, a genetics system for all of the entities
        was implemented. As mentioned earlier in the first base task, when reproducing, animals combine their parents' genetics
        to form their own, with a chance to mutate certain attributes by some mutation factor. Specifically, if \( r \in [0, 1] \)
        is a random number, then the new genetic trait is calculated as:
        \begin{equation}
            \text{value} = \text{fatherTrait} \times r + \text{motherTrait} \times (1 - r), \nonumber
        \end{equation}
        allowing for a smooth transition between the parents' traits. Then, if we define \( s \in \{-1, 1\} \) to be a random
        value, the mutation factor is applied to the new trait as follows:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{mutation-equation}
            \text{newTrait} = \text{value} + \text{value} \times \text{mutationFactor} \times s,
        \end{equation}
        where the mutation factor is a value, in the range \( [0, 1] \), that determines how drastic the mutation is.
        This system allows for a wide range of genetic diversity in the simulation, which is easily observable when
        the \verb|mutationFactor| is increased. Lastly, plants reproduce asexually, so they inherit their parent's genetics
        directly, but these can also mutate according to Equation \ref{mutation-equation}.

        \noindent \textbf{JSON Configuration File: } Almost every single aspect of the simulation is controlled from this file,
        including the entities' genetics, the environment, and the simulation parameters. The JSON file is loaded at the start
        of the simulation, and the simulation is run according to the parameters defined in the file. As well as the entity
        genetic intervals mentioned above, the following are the parameters that can be controlled in the JSON file:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \verb|foodValueForAnimals| — Scales the food value when an entity eats an animal.
            \item \verb|foodValueForPlants| — Scales the food value when entity eats a plant.
            \item \verb|animalHungerDrain| — Controls the rate of hunger drain over time.
            \item \verb|animalBreedingCost| — Scales how much food is consumed during breeding (note that food is a value
            in the range 0 to 1).
            \item \verb|mutationFactor| — How drastic the mutation changes are.
            \item \verb|entityAgeRate| — How fast entities age.
            \item \verb|fieldScaleFactor| — The size of the field, smaller value means more zoomed in.
            \item \verb|weatherChangeProbability| — The probability of the weather changing at the end of the day.
            \item \verb|windStrength| — How strong the wind pushes entities.
            \item \verb|stormMovementSpeedFactor| — How much to slow entities during a storm.
            \item \verb|dayNightCycleSpeed| — How fast the time passes in the simulation.
            \item \verb|doDayNightCycle| — Whether the day-night cycle is enabled.
            \item \verb|doWeatherCycle| — Whether the weather is enabled.
            \item \verb|showQuadTrees| — Whether to show the debug effect of quadtrees. It just looks really cool.
            \item \verb|animalHungerThreshold| — The level of hunger when an animal is considered "hungry."
            \item \verb|animalDyingOfHungerThreshold| — The level when an animal is considered to be "dying of hunger."
        \end{itemize}

        \noindent \textbf{Quadtree optimisation: } While not a visible feature, due to its complexity it is worth discussing. A quadtree is utilized to store entities, over a list. We do this to efficiently handle entity proximity checks. Each frame, entities are added to the quadtree, and when they need to find nearby entities they query the tree. This is is a major upgrade to the naiive approach of $O(n^2)$ time where every entity checks its distance to every other entity (1000 entities means 1,000,000 calls, 60 times a second). Using the quadtree for every entity has an average complexity of $O(n \log n)$ as the quadtree organises entities by proximity. Overall, this greatly improves performance, making the experience of the simulation much smoother.

        \noindent \textbf{Graphics: } We included some visual effects such as different shapes for entity types (squares for predators, circles for prey and triangles for plants) as well as rain and lightning, and a day-night darkening effect (just to make weather more visual). There is also some text describing the time, day, weather, wind direction (when windy or stormy) and current entity count.

        \section{Code Quality Considerations}

        \subsection{Coupling and Responsibility-Driven Design}
        Coupling is minimized by separating all major functions into different classes. The class structure of the program starts with the Engine class. The Engine controls the main loop of the simulation, combining the actual simulation and the graphics together.

        The Engine only stores the Display for graphics, the Simulator for updating the simulation and a Clock class for maintaining the frame rate. The engine only coordinates these classes, it does not handle their internal logic, meaning it has minimal coupling.

        Graphics are handled by the Display and Render Panel classes. The simulation is controlled by the Simulator class. All entities are stored in a Field class, which is created by a FieldBuilder class to move the population of the Field outside of the Field class, improving RDD and minimizing coupling.

        Our animals and plants originate from an Entity class. This then has Animal and Plant as subclasses, and Animal has Predator and Prey as subclasses. We ensure that any method or attribute shared by any classes is stored in their respective parent class to reduce code duplication and enforce RDD for each subclass. The subclasses strictly only do things that they do differently from other classes.

        Entity has an update() method which is called in Simulator. This minimizes coupling as all entity specific behavior remains encapsulated, while remaining easy to invoke.

        Only necessary dependencies are stored between classes, making the code base low in coupling. Naturally, by strictly following RDD for every class, we reduce the coupling further.

        \subsection{Cohesion}
        To improve cohesion, the Animal class has 4 main attributes, the AnimalMovementController, AnimalHungerController, AnimalBreedingController and AnimalBehaviourController. Each of these controls their respective function of the Animal. This massively increases cohesion as the different operations are split into different relevant sections, making the code much easier to understand. This also has the added benefit of making the Animal class quite small, and improves responsibility driven design.

        The structure of Entity and its subclasses also lends itself to high cohesion - its extremely clear what an Animal should do, and what a Predator and Prey does differently while also being Animals.

        \subsection{Maintainability}
        The JSON file and genetics system is highly modular, allowing easy modifications by updating only the JSON file and the SimulationData/AnimalData/PlantData class accordingly.

        Code is structured into packages, improving organization and making it easier to locate, modify, and extend functionality while maintaining encapsulation. The code is written with low coupling and adheres to RDD, resulting in high modularity. This means adding functionality is straightforward.

        Modular code makes unit testing very simple, as demonstrated by the unit tests in the code.

        One aspect that may prove difficult is making the simulation deterministic. The simulation is not deterministic and runs differently each time as the random number generation system uses different instances of Math.random throughout the code. This is one aspect that could be improved upon.

        \section{Final Remarks} This project implements a dynamic, modular and optimized simulation of an ecosystem. The system expands and goes beyond the base tasks, completely reworking and improving the original code.

        We hope you enjoy watching our simulation, and testing out what can create by modifying the JSON file!
